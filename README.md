This repo contains a variety of small and simple nodejs apps built with pure node code...meaning no 3rd party modules or libraries.  So there is no node_modules folder or package.json file in any of these apps.

I built these as part of my efforts to learn nodejs more deeply and explore the possibilities without the help of any 3rd party code.
